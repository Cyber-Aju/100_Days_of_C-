### 1. Repeated Substring Pattern

#### Logic:
- Iterate through possible lengths of substrings (from 1 to half the length of the string).
- For each substring length, check if the string can be formed by repeating that substring.
- If a repeated substring is found, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input string.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

#### Use Case:
- This problem is useful in scenarios where you need to identify patterns or repetitions in strings. It could be applied in various fields such as data analysis, pattern recognition, and bioinformatics.

### 2. Move Zeros

#### Logic:
- Iterate through the array, and for each non-zero element, move it to the front of the array.
- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.

#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

#### Use Case:
- This problem is common in scenarios where you need to organize or preprocess data efficiently, especially in cases where zeros need to be moved to the end of an array.

### 3. Plus One

#### Logic:
- Start from the rightmost digit and add 1 to it.
- Propagate the carry through the array.
- Handle cases where a new digit is created due to the carry.

#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), ignoring the space required for the result.

#### Use Case:
- This problem is frequently used in scenarios where you need to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers represented as arrays, such as in cryptography or numerical simulations.

### 4. Sign of the Product of an Array

#### Logic:
- Calculate the product of all values in the array while keeping track of the sign.
- Return the sign using a separate function.

#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

#### Use Case:
- This problem is relevant in situations where you need to determine the sign of a mathematical expression or the result of a series of multiplications, such as in mathematical modeling or algorithmic problem-solving.
