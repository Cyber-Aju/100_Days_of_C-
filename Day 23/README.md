# Learning Summary

## Implementing Binary Trees in C++

Today, I delved into the implementation of Binary Trees in C++. I created the following key functionalities:

### 1. Binary Tree Implementation
- Developed a basic implementation of a Binary Tree structure.
- Each node in the tree consists of a value and pointers to its left and right children.

### 2. Finding a Node in a Binary Tree
- Implemented a function to search for a specific value within the Binary Tree.
- Utilized a recursive approach for the search operation.

### 3. Sum of Nodes in a Binary Tree
- Created a function to calculate the sum of all nodes in the Binary Tree.
- Utilized Breadth-First Traversal for a systematic exploration of the tree.

## Challenges Faced

While implementing these functionalities, I encountered the following challenges:

### 1. Operator Overloading Error
- Faced an error related to the usage of the '==' operator between an integer and a string.
- Discovered the need for explicit type handling or conversion.

### 2. stoi Function for String to Integer
- Encountered an error while using `std::stoi` to convert strings to integers.
- Resolved the issue by ensuring proper handling of the conversion.

### 3. Pointer Usage
- Opted for the use of pointers to represent left and right children of each node.
- The use of '->' instead of '.' is crucial when accessing members of a structure through pointers.

## Learnings

Through today's coding session, I gained insights into the following areas:

- Enhanced understanding of Binary Tree data structures and operations.
- Improved knowledge of recursive algorithms for tree traversal.
- Learned to handle common errors related to data type mismatches and string-to-integer conversions.
- Appreciated the importance of pointers in representing and manipulating data structures.

## Next Steps

In the upcoming sessions, I plan to explore more advanced Binary Tree operations, such as deletion, balancing, and further error handling techniques.

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement..!
